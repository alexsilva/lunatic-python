This is a fork of Lunatic Python, which can be found at (https://github.com/bastibe/lunatic-python)

This is an updated version of lunatic-python that works with Python 2.7 and Lua 3.2.

Installing
----------

To install, you will need to have the Python and Lua development libraries on your system. If you
do, use the recommended methods (```pip```, ```easy-install```, etc) to install lunatic-python.

This version has been modified to compile under Ubuntu. I haven't tested it under other
distributions, your mileage may vary.
